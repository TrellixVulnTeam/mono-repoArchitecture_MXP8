# MONO_REPO-ARCHITECTURE
A Monorepository is an architectural concept, which basically contains all the meaning in its title. Instead of managing multiple repositories, you keep all your isolated code parts inside one repository. Keep in mind the word isolatedâ€”it means that monorepo has nothing in common with monolithic apps. You can keep many kinds of logical apps inside one repo; for example, a website and its iOS app.
